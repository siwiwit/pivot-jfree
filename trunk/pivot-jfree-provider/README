
Pivot-JFree-Provider
====================

This is the implementation of the provider for Pivot-JFree.


Information
===========

This project is built from ant (in the parent folder), but to simplify development and debugging there are even
eclipse project files (.project and .classpath), and in this case Pivot jars are not used (they are used by the ant build)
but it references usual Pivot projects in the same workspace (charts, core, wtk, wtk-terra).

In the lib folder there are required dependencies (and in the lib_doc and lib_src related javadoc and src jars),
downloaded from a Maven repository, and here only to help development inside eclipse.
